# CoreDataTest2
I'm working on a small app that includes elements of Core Data and a sprinkling of Combine. I'm sharing my work to indicate competence to potential employers.

Targeting iOS 13 to include diffable data sources for UITableView and to allow use of Combine. May in future switch from UITableView to UICollectionView with iOS 14's new list view.
